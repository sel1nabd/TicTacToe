# TicTacToe READ ME

I'm making a YouTube video about this currently.

This project is less about the outcome (trust me this game is definitely not the most sophisticated, if you're looking to make the GTA V of tictactoe this is the wrong place), 
and more about the load of baby steps it will teach you.

These steps are the kind of subconcious skills you'll learn to develop as you start to program yourself, but essentially I tried to include a lot of them from my own learning which I've noticed not many code "teachers" doing.

Anyway I highly recommend watching the video and not just looking at the code - even if you can't be bothered to watch it through, I outline some steps on how you can learn without just looking and copying.
